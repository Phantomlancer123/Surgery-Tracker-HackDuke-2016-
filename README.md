# README

This is a project on developing a web app for the families of in-surgery patients. The family members will create their accounts which will be synchronized with the patients' surgery status page. They will be getting real-time updates during the surgery and receive notifications on when they can consult the doctors/surgeons regarding the surgery or the state of the patients. We used Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

The main html file is located in:
app --> views --> patient --> index.html
